Next Step

I will begin with Step 1.1: Analysis of the TCP Protocol and TCP/IP Model, as it forms the foundation for understanding the server-side communication in the application. Let me proceed with this research.

Below is the complete technical design report that covers the project’s entire scope—from foundational background research to detailed server‐side and client‐side design. This report is organized into several sections that integrate research data, annotated diagrams (or their descriptions), and evidence‐based design decisions. The report is intended for a server-side web application (a Movie/TV Show recommendation system) developed with PHP on the backend, and HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript on the frontend. The application targets Google Chrome, features a user review system, and includes a ranking scheme, a streaming service overview, and detailed individual views. All content is prepared in accordance with the coursework requirements, using Harvard referencing where applicable.

1. Introduction

This Technical Design Report details the design of a Movie/TV Show recommendation system. The design focuses on two broad areas: the server‐side architecture that handles data modeling, request processing, and workflow management; and the client‐side interface design, addressing layout, navigation, and user interactions via responsive wireframes. The report is structured to provide exhaustive details on relevant technologies, design decisions, and interface layouts.

The main goals of the application are: • To present a well‐integrated list of movie and TV show recommendations with editorial and user reviews. • To offer a dynamic, responsive user interface that functions effectively on both desktop and mobile views. • To allow authenticated users to post reviews, with data stored externally (e.g., in a JSON file). • To incorporate a ranking system that sorts movies/TV shows by recommendation scores, average user ratings, and other key facts. • To provide an overview of a streaming service (subscription details, availability, and media-rich content).

2. Background Research
2.1 Analysis of the TCP Protocol and TCP/IP Model

Definition and Role
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented networking protocol responsible for establishing and managing a reliable communication channel between hosts. Operating at the Transport layer of the TCP/IP model, TCP ensures data packets are transmitted in sequence, without loss, and with error checking.

How TCP Works
TCP uses a three-way handshake for connection establishment: • The client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to initiate communication. • The server replies with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet. • The client sends an ACK (acknowledge) message to confirm.
After the handshake, data is segmented into packets, and each packet is acknowledged by the receiving end. Features such as flow control, congestion control, and retransmission on lost packets ensure reliability.

Characteristics and Advantages
TCP: • Guarantees in-order delivery and error detection via checksums. • Implements congestion and flow control mechanisms. • Requires a reliable channel, making it ideal for applications like web browsing, file transfers, and email (where data integrity is critical).

Comparison with UDP
Unlike TCP, User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is connectionless and does not guarantee delivery or order: • UDP is faster due to reduced overhead. • UDP is suited for real-time applications (voice or video streaming) where speed outweighs reliability. Thus, while UDP is preferred for low-latency communication, TCP is chosen for applications where accuracy is critical.

The TCP/IP 4-Layer Model
The TCP/IP model comprises: • Application Layer (protocols like HTTP, FTP) • Transport Layer (TCP, UDP) • Internet Layer (IP, ICMP) • Network Access Layer (Ethernet, Wi-Fi)
A common diagram representation is:

            Application
            -----------
              TCP/UDP
            -----------
            Internet (IP)
            -----------
            Network Access


Comparison to the OSI Model
The OSI model consists of 7 layers compared to TCP/IP’s 4 layers. While the OSI model provides a more detailed abstraction, the TCP/IP model is more practical and is widely implemented in real-world systems. The TCP/IP layers map onto the OSI layers as follows: • Application (OSI layers 5–7) • Transport (OSI layer 4) • Internet (OSI layer 3) • Network Access (OSI layers 1–2)

2.2 Existing Site Analysis: Critique of IMDb

Overview and Key Functionality
IMDb is a leading movie/TV show recommendation website known for its rich database. Its primary features include detailed information pages for movies and TV shows, user reviews and ratings, search functionality, and editorial content.

Usability
IMDb’s interface is designed for responsiveness and ease of navigation: • The homepage features multimedia cards with thumbnails, textual descriptions, and quick navigation links. • Navigation menus (top bar and sidebars) use CSS transitions and JavaScript for smooth interactivity. • The user interface separates key functions (search bar, login, review submission) so that navigating large volumes of data is streamlined.

Search and Review Functionality
The search function is robust and supports various filters (genre, year, rating), making it user-friendly. The reviews section displays both professional critic reviews and user-submitted ratings. Ratings are aggregated to provide an average benchmark score, making the system dynamic and comprehensive.

Critique Summary
• The extensive information hierarchy can be overwhelming for new users.
• While the desktop layout is rich, the mobile adaptation—although functional—sometimes compromises detailed data presentation for brevity.
• Overall, IMDb excels in usability and information architecture, serving as an excellent benchmark for the design of a recommendation system.

3. Server-Side Design

3.2 Server-Side Logic Activity Diagram

The server-side workflow for generating the individual movie/TV show details view involves a series of steps that ensure data integrity, proper retrieval, and dynamic content rendering:

Request Validation
• The server receives an HTTP GET request (e.g., movie.php?id=1) and validates the input.

Data Retrieval
• Query the database (or file storage) to fetch key facts (title, director, cast, releaseDate, ageRating, etc.).
• Retrieve associated data:
  – UserReviews from the JSON file.
  – ExternalReviews linked to the movie/TV show.

Score Calculation
• Compute the average user rating based on all user reviews.
• Determine editorial recommendation scores and identify the highest-scoring entry if needed.

Data Aggregation and Rendering
• Organize data into a structured layout (key facts, description, reviews, and recommendation details).
• Render the view dynamically using PHP templating.

Response Rendering
• Send the aggregated data to the client for HTML rendering.

An example ASCII flow diagram is as follows:

 [Start]
   │
   ▼


[Validate HTTP GET Request] │ ▼ [Query Database/JSON File for Movie Data] │ ▼ [Retrieve User and External Reviews] │ ▼ [Calculate Average Ratings & Recommendation Scores] │ ▼ [Aggregate Data for View] │ ▼ [Render HTML with PHP Template] │ ▼ [Send Response]
